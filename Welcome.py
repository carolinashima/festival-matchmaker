    Every year I have the same problem: too many festivals, too little time (and money!).
    I built this little app to help me choose which festival to go to 
    according to how well their lineups match [my taste](https://www.last.fm/user/caro_g), instead of
    sitting for hours checking out each individual artist in a lineup. I mean, I probably will still do that, but
    at least I will know what to check out first!

    You can find the repo for this app and a couple of notebooks [here](https://github.com/carolinashima/festival-matchmaker).

    * My user profile was built with my top 150 artists, which I think is representative of my general taste in music
    but is also biased against post-rock, for example.
    * Artist similarity was calculated by retrieving tags on Last.fm, so: 1) I wasn't able to calculate similarity for
    very small artists that haven't been scrobbled; 2) tags are added manually by users, so a bunch of them are either not
    related to genre or are sometimes just [weird/funny](https://www.last.fm/tag/if+this+were+a+pokemon+i+would+catch+it).
    * Artists with special characters (e.g. &) were not processed correctly with the Last.fm API so I have no similarity scores
    for them either.
    * The 40 festivals were chosen manually by looking at Setlist.fm's lists of festivals in 2024. Partly because I had to
    scrape them and partly because I'm probably not interested in attending most festivals that exist in the world.
